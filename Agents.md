  - Added logout button to header
  - Removed `userId` arguments from all frontend query/mutation calls
- ✅ Cleaned up unused imports across all page components
- ✅ Repository hygiene: refreshed `.gitignore` for Node/Vite/Convex outputs

**Key Files Modified:**
- **Backend:** `convex/auth.ts`, `convex/http.ts`, `convex/schema.ts`, `convex/recipes.ts`, `convex/pantry.ts`, `convex/shoppingList.ts`, `convex/mealPlans.ts`, `convex/cooking.ts`

## Agent Guidelines

### Build, Lint, and Test Commands

```bash
# Development
bun run dev              # Start dev server
bun run build            # Production build
bun run preview          # Preview production build

# Code Quality
bun run lint             # Run ESLint

# Testing
bun run test             # Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:run         # Run tests once (CI)
bun run test:ui          # Run with UI
bun run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
bun run test -- <file>   # Run single test file
bun run test -- -t "pattern"  # Run tests matching pattern

# Convex
bun convex dev           # Start Convex dev server
bun convex deploy        # Deploy to production
```

### Code Style Guidelines

**TypeScript:** ES2022 target, strict mode, no unused locals/parameters

**Imports:** Group by category - React/Vite → Convex → Libraries → Local
```typescript
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useQuery } from 'convex/react'
import { ChefHat } from 'lucide-react'
import { useTheme } from './ThemeContext'
import type { Id } from '../../convex/_generated/dataModel'
```

**Naming:**
- Components: PascalCase (AuthForm.tsx)
- Hooks/Utils: camelCase (useTheme, scaleQuantity)
- Types: PascalCase (ThemeContextType)
- Convex: camelCase exports (getAll, create)

**Components:** Function declarations with props interface
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string
  onClick: () => void
}

export function Button({ label, onClick }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>
}
```

**Error Handling:** Check auth first in Convex, throw descriptive errors, use try-catch in components

**Type Safety:** No `any` types, use `Id<"table">`, strict null checks

**Convex Pattern:** Auth check → Ownership check → Business logic

**Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS variables for themes, Lucide icons (no emojis)

**Testing:** Use describe/it blocks, mock dependencies, test success + error cases, cleanup after each test

### Critical Rules
- Never commit secrets (.env.local is gitignored)
- Don't modify convex/_generated/
- Always run lint before committing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Check authentication in all Convex functions
- Use TypeScript strict mode

## Future Roadmap (Backlog)

- [ ] **Data Visualization:** Charts for ingredient usage over time.
- [ ] **Sharing:** Share recipes with other users via link (requires deeper auth logic).
- [ ] **Import:** Scrape recipes from URLs.
